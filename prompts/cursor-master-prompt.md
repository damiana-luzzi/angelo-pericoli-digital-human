# Cursor Master Prompt

You are a senior software architect, UX designer, AI engineer and Digital Heritage specialist.

Your task is to build the first production-ready version of:

# Angelo Pericoli Digital Human

## Project Vision

Angelo Pericoli is the human interface of a digital knowledge ecosystem.

The project explores how professional memory, scientific knowledge and documentary heritage can be integrated into an interactive digital ecosystem through a Digital Human.

The first use case is the Digital Ecosystems for Heritage 4.0 Symposium.

The Digital Human interacts with:

* Prof. Grazia Tucci
* conference participants
* researchers
* students

through voice and text.

The system provides access to:

* Angelo Pericoli memories
* symposium contents
* keynote abstracts
* special sessions
* extended abstracts
* digital heritage knowledge

## Existing Project Documentation

Use the project documents located in:

/docs
/prompts
/knowledge-base

In particular:

* vision.md
* character-bible.md
* knowledge-architecture.md
* user-scenarios.md
* application-architecture.md
* persona-prompt.md

These documents define the project and must guide all architectural and design decisions.

## General Requirements

Create a Progressive Web Application.

The application must work on:

* Desktop
* Laptop
* Tablet
* Smartphone

The application must be designed for future evolution.

Do not hardcode any symposium-specific logic.

The system must support future Digital Humans, future events and future knowledge bases.

## Design Principles

The application must communicate:

* cultural heritage
* scientific credibility
* elegance
* accessibility

Visual inspiration:

* historical cartography
* surveying
* Florence
* cultural heritage
* digital ecosystems

Avoid:

* futuristic robots
* gaming aesthetics
* commercial chatbot appearance

Use warm neutral colours.

Use excellent typography.

Prioritize readability.

## Core User Experiences

### Experience 1

Live dialogue between Angelo Pericoli and Prof. Grazia Tucci.

### Experience 2

Public interaction during the Symposium.

### Experience 3

Scientific exploration of symposium content.

### Experience 4

Educational interaction.

## Application Structure

Create the following modules:

### AvatarRenderer

Responsible for:

* avatar rendering
* facial expressions
* lip sync
* gaze behaviour

The avatar must be replaceable in the future.

The avatar model must not be hardcoded.

### CharacterConfig

Stores:

* character identity
* behaviour
* personality
* visual settings

Future characters must be supported.

### VoiceConfig

Stores:

* voice settings
* speech parameters
* language settings

Future voices must be supported.

### ChatService

Handles:

* conversation
* message history
* AI interaction

### SpeechService

Handles:

* speech-to-text
* text-to-speech

### KnowledgeBaseService

Handles:

* documents
* retrieval
* source references

The architecture must be ready for future RAG integration.

### PersonaPrompt

Loads the Angelo Pericoli persona.

### DemoMode

Supports conference presentations.

Features:

* preset questions
* large subtitles
* presentation layout

### PublicMode

Supports public interaction.

### AdminDashboard

Supports:

* document upload
* knowledge management
* content review

## Phase 1 Scope

For now:

DO NOT integrate real AI APIs.

DO NOT integrate real RAG.

DO NOT integrate real speech providers.

DO NOT integrate databases.

Use:

* mock responses
* mock voice service
* placeholder avatar area

The goal is to create the complete application architecture and user experience.

## Accessibility

Support:

* text interaction
* voice interaction
* subtitles
* keyboard navigation
* mobile devices

Accessibility must be considered from the beginning.

## Deliverables

Generate:

* project structure
* components
* pages
* services
* configuration files

Create clean, maintainable and well-documented code.

Explain architectural decisions when useful.

Prioritize extensibility and long-term maintainability.
